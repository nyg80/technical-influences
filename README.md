technical-influences
====================

**Derek Sivers** – I remember I first found him through his article “Delegate or Die: The Self-Employed Trap.”  Since then, I have read many of his essays which I have found to be full of relevant, practical insights into entrepreneurship, technology, and personal growth.  Most of the books I've read in the last few years have come from his list of book reviews (sivers.org/book).

**Patrick McKenzie** aka Patio11 – A guru at SaaS optimizations and programming career advice.  Everything he writes makes so much sense.  I think the first piece by him that really struck me was “Don't Call Yourself a Programmer, and other Career Advice.”  His posts are long, but so incredibly full of useful information.  I think I am a lot like him, however to write with a voice as good as his I would need lots and lots more practice.  When I develop a SaaS of my own, I will be implementing most, if not all of the tips he has published. 

**Joel Gascoigne** (founder of Buffer App) – He first had me hooked when I read his post about how he knew it would pay off to build Buffer, before he even started programming (http://blog.bufferapp.com/idea-to-paying-customers-in-7-weeks-how-we-did-it).  Ever since then, watching his progress as he grows his company has been incredibly informative, inspirational, and motivating.

**Bruce Schneier** – Ever since the whistle blowing of William Binney (and much more recently, Edward Snowden), I have been very privacy conscious.  Schneier's blog on security has been an up-to-date, informative, pragmatic voice of reason in the debate on security, privacy, mass surveillance, and spying.  

**Richard Stallman** aka RMS – I look up to RMS for his technical chops, as well as his way of sticking to his principles on controversial topics of today, including Facebook (http://stallman.org/facebook.html) and software being free (as in speech).

**Paul Graham** aka PG – My freshman year of college I came across one of his essays, and I went on to read all of them.  After reading all his essays, I started reading Hacker News and was hooked.  He presents many well thought out ideas, and it is often easier for me to simply refer someone to one of his essays rather than explain a point, such as what he covers in “Maker's vs. Manager's Schedule.”
